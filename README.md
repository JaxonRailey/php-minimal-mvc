# PHP minimal MVC

Whoever wants to know what's behind the scenes of a framework has a lot to study but can start from here :wink:

This repository is probably the simplest version of an MVC system, useful for those who want to create a frameworkless project without sacrificing the convenience of the organization that guarantees the MVC pattern.

Clearly it is only useful for educational purposes, to understand how to divide the code according to the task.

**M** the model has the role of querying the database;  
**V** the view hosts the html code that will be displayed in the browser;  
**C** the controller contains the logic of the project and takes care of the data exchange between model and view.

:muscle: The more daring could use it as a base to create their own personal framework.

:star: **If you liked what I did, if it was useful to you or if it served as a starting point for something more magical let me know with a star** :green_heart:
